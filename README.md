Welcome to my Object Detection project using OpenCV! 
This project is designed to perform real-time object detection through your webcam using a pre-trained deep learning model. Let's dive into the details.

Project Overview:
Technology Stack
Python
OpenCV

Object Detection Model:
The project employs the SSD MobileNet V3 model trained on the COCO dataset.
SSD (Single Shot Multibox Detector) is a popular object detection algorithm, 
and MobileNet V3 is a lightweight deep neural network architecture suitable for real-time applications.

Webcam Integration
Using OpenCV, the project captures video frames from your webcam and processes them through the object detection model.
Detected objects are then annotated with bounding boxes and labels in real-time
